At Adidas, we are rebellious optimists driven by action, with a desire to shape a better future together. We see the world of sport and culture with possibility whereas others only see the impossible. ‘Impossible is Nothing’ is not a slogan for us. By being optimistic and knowing the power of sport, we see endless possibilities to apply this power and empower all people through action.
